/*Create a function uniqueList that would remove duplicate elements of the array.
For example: var array = [1,3,0,7,0,1,2,9,3,1,8,2,7,] should return a newArray = [1,3,0,7,2,9,8,] */

//create an array myFamily containing 5 objects. Each object has 3 properties - name, age, birthYear
// create a function birthday that would return only the objects with birthYear after 1970.
