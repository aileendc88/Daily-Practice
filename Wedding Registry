/*You were asked to take arrays of items for wedding gifts and turn them into a registry. Take the items below and put them into 
an obj called weddingRegistry that will list each item as the property and who it is from and how much it costs as the value. The 
function should be able to handle newly added items.  

**All cash should be added up and returned as one key/value pair, however, the value should include each person who gave cash.**

The items are listed in order i.e: Toaster is from Uncle Bob and is 20 dollars
