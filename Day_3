/*solve using higher order functions.

write a function that would return the number of quarters in each number value*/

/*create an array of strings. write a function that would output an object with the string as property and value equal to the
string with each character duplicated. example: var string = ["ant", "bug"] should return  var obj = {ant:"aanntt", "bug":"bbuugg"}*/

// flatten the array below.
var myList = [3,[4,5,6],[7,8],[9,10]];

// using the flattened array, write a function that would return the sum of all even numbers and product of all odd numbers
